    "3. Generate the report as a html file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope  \n",
    "The research must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Size**: Current global/regional market value and volume, plus 3–5 year growth projections.  \n",
    "- **Key Players**: Major brands (e.g., Nespresso, Keurig, Lavazza), their market share, pricing, and distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements  \n",
    "- Use data from the last 18 months  \n",
    "- Highlight sustainability aspects (e.g., recyclability, consumer concerns)  \n",
